    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
        When I was studying at CMU the 5th homework of 15-214 was to develop a data visualization
        framework that was complex enough to support various fields, but modular enough to support easy plugin
        integration. The framework was developed as a Java <code>JFrame</code> application.
        It was developed with <a href="https://wchargin.github.io/">William Chargin</a>, my teammate.
    </p>
    <p>
        The framework allows users to write data source plugins like .csv file readers, and data visualization plugins
        like choropleth maps. The key aspect of our design was to be as flexible as possible, therefore our framework
        can process all kinds of data that can be represented in a tabular form.
    </p>

    <h3>Features</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Build entirely on pure Java code. The framework takes advantage of the new Java 8 features, like lambdas
        and streams.</li>
        <li>The framework comes with 3 data source plugins by default: a csv reader, a mathematical equation translator
        (accepts only inputs in RPN format), and a k-dimensional randomness generator.</li>
        <li>The framework comes with 4 data visualization plugins by default: bubble charts, histograms, raw data
            visualization (like excel), and statistical analysis reports.</li>
        <li>
            Uses <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/310c99e53880faec2434">
            Bostock/Niccoli's Cubehelix Perceptual Rainbow</a> for color generation.
        </li>
        <li>
            It was awarded best framework of the course of Spring 2016.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deployment</h3>

    <p>
        Sadly the source code and executable files cannot be shared due to academic integrity constraints.
