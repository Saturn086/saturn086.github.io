    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
        My team and I decided to focus our final project application on education. We talked with our teacher and
        she got us in a Prep@Net project alongside the physics department. Our goal was to make a nice looking and
        easy to use application for learning projectile motion in two dimensions. The app is directed towards
        high school students
        with low levels of income. It has a simulator that shows information about the particles movement in time.
        It also enables them to make comparisons between simulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game was inspired on the <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">PhET simulations</a>
        by the University of Colorado, but made local and mobile to
        inspire students to use it in places were no internet connection is available. E.g. taking the bus home.
    </p>

    <h3>Features</h3>

    <p>The app is comprised of 3 main sections: the simulator, an instructions manual for app usage and simulator
    handling, and a series of randomized questions to test the students understanding of the subject.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The simulation can be initialized with force, angle, and displacement parameters.</li>
        <li>The app handles the International Metric System and the Imperial System.</li>
        <li>The simulation can be seen second by second and it can be retraced to the start.</li>
        <li>The questions generated by the app come or are derived from Sears and Zemansky's
            University Physics with Modern Physics book.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deployment</h3>

    <p>
        The app is currently being processed to be made available to the public through the app store.
