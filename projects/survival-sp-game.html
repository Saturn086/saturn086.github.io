    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
        Back in 2015 I took the video game development course as an introduction to Java through game
        design and programming. This game was the final course project and was developed by a team of four,
        including myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game is set on the 1920's as you, an eager archaeologist, delve into a recently discovered tomb
        just to find yourself trapped in a maze full of monsters. The main objective is to escape by either fighting or
        evading monsters, it is a game of action-packed exploration.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game has over 7,000 lines of code since it was developed from scratch using only an animation library. The
        theme, gameplay and feel to it was inspired by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl's
        <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/">The Binding of Isaac</a>.
    </p>

        The game can be downloaded <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ngkas6assvdpox/no_way_out.jar?dl=0">here</a>.
