<h2>Hello there!</h2>
<hr>

<span class="home-content">
    <p>
I am currently studying to get my major in Computer Science at
<a href="http://www.itesm.mx/wps/wcm/connect/ITESM/Tecnologico+de+Monterrey/English">
    Instituto Tecnológico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey</a>
(ITESM for short). I've been very passionate about science and technology
since as far as junior highschool. That's why I always try to learn
new things, and as result, most of my free time goes to studying.</p>
<p>I love 
programmig, developing apps, webpages, and videogames (also playing them).
Other hobbies of mine include: Aikido, hiking, fishing, and watching
movies.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to add that I had the
opportunity to attend <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">
    Carnegie Mellon University</a> as an exchange student 
for Spring and Fall of 2016, 
and I am a proficient spanish, english and german speaker.
Without further delay, welcome to my personal webpage and portfolio,
feel free to look around!</p>
