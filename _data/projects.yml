        my team and I chose to develop an app for the university's High School program.
        Its main focus was to help students learn about the principles of
        motion in two planes through example. The app lets them configure the parameters of the simulation and graph the
        results, enabling experimentation and learning in an interactive way.
        The app makes use of Philipp Jahoda's Charts <a href='https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts'>API</a> and is
        currently being processed to be uploaded to the app store."

        in which we learn more complex software
        design concepts. For the final project, my team decided
        to develop a single-player survival videogame using <code>JFrame</code>.
        Our game featured auto-generated levels and environments to improve
        player experience and replayablity. For this project I acted as team
        leader, concept designer, and programmer; as such, I designed the
        algorithms for level randomness, level generation, as well as the core
        logic of the game. The game can be downloaded and played
        <a href="https://github.com/Saturn086/Kye-Studios">here</a>.

    description: This was the fifth homework for course
        <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~charlie/courses/15-214/">15-214</a> and
        the first to be developed in teams. The objective of this homework was
        to learn and practice framework development.
        My partner and I decided to create it
        using <code>JFrame</code> and provide it with a user–friendly interface.
        One of our core objectives was to make it general enough to support
        a large array of user–made plugins with graph capabilities. As a result,
        it was awarded best framework of the course of Spring 2016.

        as the final project, designed to consolidate all the
        material about web development learned during the semester.
        Therefore, my partner and I decided to create a multi player online
        tank video game in which new users create an account and battle
        against other players to win points and upgrade/customize their
        tank. For a more realistic experience we used
        <a href='http://box2d.org/'>Box2d</a>
        physics engine alongside the HTML5 canvas, AJAX, and JQuery. The game
        was recognized as one of the best of Spring 2016 and is deployed on
        <a href='https://illuve.herokuapp.com/'>Heroku</a>."

    description: 'This project was developed for <i>Semana i</i>,
	a special week of Tec of Monterrey, much like a Hackathon
	where we must build, develop, or do something new as a project.
	I was part of the group that would work with the IBM Watson API.
	My team and I made a mobile app for first aid assistance (in spanish)
	that uses IBM Watson to communicate more effectively with the user.
