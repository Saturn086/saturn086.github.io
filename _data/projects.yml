        In order to raise the level of difficulty,
        the professor chose my team to collaborate with a
        team from 9<sup>th</sup> semester in their final project.
        Our task was to develop the internal structure and database
        of their website. Therefore, I took
        on the role of Scrum Master, programmer and
        quality manager for half of the team.
        The website is currently running on one of the
        university's servers and the source code can be viewed

        in which we learn more complex software
        design concepts. For the final project, my team decided
        to develop a single-player survival videogame using <code>JFrame</code>.
        Our game featured auto-generated levels and environments to improve
        player experience and replayablity. For this project I acted as team
        leader, concept designer, and programmer; as such, I designed the
        algorithms for level randomness, level generation, as well as the core
        logic of the game. The game can be downloaded and played
        <a href="https://github.com/Saturn086/Kye-Studios">here</a>.

    description: This was the fifth homework for course
        <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~charlie/courses/15-214/">15-214</a> and
        the first to be developed in teams. The objective of this homework was
        to learn and practice framework development.
        My partner and I decided to create it
        using <code>JFrame</code> and provide it with a user–friendly interface.
        One of our core objectives was to make it general enough to support
        a large array of user–made plugins with graph capabilities. As a result,
        it was awarded best framework of the course of Spring 2016.

        <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./15-437/">15-437</a>
        as the final project, designed to consolidate all the
        material about web development learned during the semester.
        Therefore, my partner and I decided to create a multiplayer online
        tank videogame in which new users create an account and battle
        against other players to win points and upgrade/customize their
        tank. For a more realistic experience we used
        <a href="http://box2d.org/">Box2d</a>
        physics engine alongside the HTML5 canvas and JQuery. The game
        was recognized as one of the best of Spring 2016 and is deployed on
        <a href="https://rocky-lake-75049.herokuapp.com/illuve">Heroku</a>.
