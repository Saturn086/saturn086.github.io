        Java is my language<br>
        of choice and the one I am most<br>
        comfortable with. I learned it at CMU<br>
        and I am proud to say that it is the first<br>
        language of which I have also learned its <br>
        culture. I program in it using <em>Effective Java</em><br>
        as a quality standard and I can work with it<br>
        comfortably from Java 5 up to 8; being<br>
        able to use features like Streams,<br>
        Swing, and Lambdas."

        C++ was the first<br>
        programming language I learned.<br>
        I admire the power and versatility it gives<br>
        to the programmer, letting him go from a<br>
        high level of absraction to getting really close<br>
        to system if needed. All my fundametal<br>
        courses at ITESM were given in this<br>
        language. Taking course 15-213 at CMU let<br>
	learn C and system level programming in<br>
	which now I can work comfortably."

        I started learning Python<br>
        for Web Development because I<br>
        was required to use Django. I knew<br>
        I had to gain proficiency in at least<br>
        one scripting language, therefore I went<br>
        deeper into Python. I like the speed in which<br>
        I can program, the clutter free syntax,<br>
        and the less rigid type system. It is<br>
        also my language of choice for Data<br>
        Science which is of my main fields<br>
        of interest.<br>"

        Arriving at CMU<br>
        I discovered functional<br>

        I took advantage of my summer vacations to<br>
        finally learn it, and I must confess it has<br>
        truly been a delight. It is a beautiful<br>
        language, well thought of, and very fun<br>
        to use. I wouldn't be surprised if<br>
        it becomes my favorite language<br>
        in the future."
