        language of which I have also learned its <br>
        culture. I program in it using <em>Effective Java</em><br>
        as a quality standard and I can work with it<br>
        comfortably from Java 5 up to 8; being<br>
        able to use features like Streams,<br>
        Swing, and Lambdas."

        I admire the power and versatility it gives<br>
        to the programmer, letting him go from a<br>
        high level of absraction to getting really close<br>
        to system if needed. All my fundametal<br>
        courses at ITESM were given in this<br>
        language. However, I am  unfamiliar<br>
        with the core concepts that it<br>
        comes from, that is C."

        I had to gain proficiency in at least<br>
        one scripting language, therefore I went<br>
        deeper into Python. I like the speed in<br>
        which I can program, the clutter free<br>
        syntax, and the less rigid type system.<br>
        I still have to learn the advanced<br>
        features of the language, but more<br>
        importantly its culture."

        I took advantage of my summer vacations to<br>

        truly been a delight. It is a beautiful<br>
        language, well thought of, and very fun<br>
        to use. I wouldn't be surprised if<br>
        it becomes my favorite language<br>
