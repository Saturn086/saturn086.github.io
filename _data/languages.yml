        I admire the power and versatility it gives
        to the programmer, letting him go from a
        high level of abstraction to getting really close
        to system if needed. All my fundamental
        courses at ITESM were given in this
        language. Taking course 15-213 at CMU let
	    learn C and system level programming in
